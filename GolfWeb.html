      The Country Club, located in Brookline, Massachusetts,
      is the oldest country club in the United States. It holds an important
      place in golf history, as it is one of the five charter clubs that
      founded the United States Golf Association, and has hosted numerous
      USGA tournaments including the 1913 U.S. Open won by then-unknown
      Francis Ouimet. Today, the club has nearly 1300 members.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club originally was founded 136 years ago in 1882, and is listed
      on the USGA's list of the first 100 clubs in America. The original
      club was focused on horseback-riding and other outdoor activities;
      the golf course was not built until 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1913 U.S. Open was held at The Country Club. The heavy favorites
      were English legends Harry Vardon (1900 U.S. Open winner; four-time
      British Open winner) and Ted Ray (reigning British Open champion).
      After 72 holes the pair found themselves tied with 20-year-old amateur
      Francis Ouimet — who had grown up across the street from the course and
      was a former caddy at the club — forcing an 18-hole playoff the next day.
      In a shocking upset, Ouimet soundly defeated the two professional golfers
      in front of a large gallery, and the resulting newspaper stories captured
      the imagination of the American public. The number of golfers in the
      country at least tripled in the subsequent ten years, with a corresponding
      increase in golf courses (including many public courses, opening up the
      game to a larger segment of the population).
      The golf facilities have a total of 27 holes, divided between two courses.
    </p>

      The Main Course is composed of the Clyde and Squirrel nines,
      essentially the original 18 holes. This was the course used for the
      1913 U.S. Open, and is the course played by members today.
