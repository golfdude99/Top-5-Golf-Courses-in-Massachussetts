    <p>
      "The Country Club, located in Brookline, Massachusetts,
      is the oldest country club in the United States. It holds an important
      place in golf history, as it is one of the five charter clubs that
      founded the United States Golf Association, and has hosted numerous
      USGA tournaments including the 1913 U.S. Open won by then-unknown
      Francis Ouimet. Today, the club has nearly 1300 members."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The club originally was founded 136 years ago in 1882, and is listed
      on the USGA's list of the first 100 clubs in America. The original
      club was focused on horseback-riding and other outdoor activities;
      the golf course was not built until 1893."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 1913 U.S. Open was held at The Country Club. The heavy favorites
      were English legends Harry Vardon (1900 U.S. Open winner; four-time
      British Open winner) and Ted Ray (reigning British Open champion).
      After 72 holes the pair found themselves tied with 20-year-old amateur
      Francis Ouimet — who had grown up across the street from the course and
      was a former caddy at the club — forcing an 18-hole playoff the next day.
      In a shocking upset, Ouimet soundly defeated the two professional golfers
      in front of a large gallery, and the resulting newspaper stories captured
      the imagination of the American public. The number of golfers in the
      country at least tripled in the subsequent ten years, with a corresponding
      increase in golf courses (including many public courses, opening up the
      game to a larger segment of the population).
      The golf facilities have a total of 27 holes, divided between two courses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Main Course is composed of the Clyde and Squirrel nines,
      essentially the original 18 holes. This was the course used for the
      1913 U.S. Open, and is the course played by members today." (Wikipedia)

      "Old Sandwich Golf Club may be the craftiest Coore-Crenshaw design yet built.
      Amidst its pines, scrub oaks, gnarly bunkers, chocolate drop mounds,
      wavy fescue and briar bushes are hints of Baltusrol, National Golf Links,
      Pine Valley, Pinehurst No 2 and Chicago Golf Club in its cross-bunkering,
      hazard placement and sandy waste areas. The greens are some of the most
      rolling of any Coore & Crenshaw design, seeded with a half-dozen bent
      varieties to give them an old-fashioned mottled appearance. Nobody does
      old-fashioned better than Coore & Crenshaw." (Golf Digest)

      "Only recently, with the discovery of some original blueprints,
      has it been conclusively established that the ocean-side,
      links-like Kittansett, long thought to be the product of an amateur architect,
      Frederic Hood, was actually the work of well-known course architect William Flynn,
      who also designed Shinnecock and Cherry Hills. Credit that revelation to
      authors Wayne S. Morrison and Thomas E. Paul, who reveal that and much more
      in their massive 2,260-page biography of Flynn entitled "The Nature Faker:
      William S. Flynn, Golf Architect." Credit Gil Hanse with restoring the
      bunkers without the aid of those Flynn plans. Instead,
      he used old aerial photographs." (Golf Digest)

      "Boston Golf Club, in the south suburb of Hingham,
      is a modern-day Pine Valley,
      massaged by architect Gil Hanse and his team from dramatic coastal
      topography with gashes of unsullied sand. Fairways tumble across the landscape,
      posing some blind shots that are embraced, not criticized.
      One stretch surrounds an old strip mine, with mining spoils
      incorporated as chocolate drop mounds and one vein serving as a
      "Hell's Third Acre" hazard. Boston Golf Club finishes with a grand par 3." (Golf Digest)

      "Myopia Hunt Club is a foxhunting and private country club in the
      northeastern United States, located in South Hamilton, Massachusetts,
      northeast of Boston. In the early years of the U.S. Open, the club hosted
      it four times: 1898, 1901, 1905, and 1908."

      "Myopia Hunt Club was founded 136 years ago in 1882 by J. Murray Forbes.
      The golf course was designed and built by Herbert C. Leeds in 1894
      and he continued working at the Club for over 30 years. Leeds tied for
      seventh place in the 1898 U.S. Open held at Myopia Hunt Club.
      His familiarity with the course was no doubt a factor in his ability
      to finish so high on the leaderboard in the tournament.
      The name "Myopia" is due to some of its founding members having come
      from the Myopia Club in Winchester, Massachusetts, which had been founded
      by four brothers with poor vision, or myopia. Today,
      the Myopia Hunt Club is a drag hunt, meaning that the hounds follow a
      laid scent rather than live fox.
      When completed, Myopia Hunt Club measured 6,539 yards and Leeds made
      certain that golfers would encounter a multitude of challenging features,
      including tall mounds, deep bunkers, lightning-fast greens, blind shots
      requiring substantial carry, deep swales, punishing rough, plateaued
      greens, as well as a pond and paddock to avoid. So difficult was the
      course that in the 1901 U.S. Open not a single professional was able to
      break 80 in any round." (Wikipedia)
